\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

%We implemented \ourtool using the WALA
%framework~\cite{wala}. 
\ourtool uses the WALA framework~\cite{wala} to perform offline
bytecode instrumentation. The instrumentation code
records the execution of every statement and the evaluation
result of each predicate. \ourtool also uses WALA
to analyze Java bytecode statically to
identify the affecting configuration options
for each predicate that behaves differently across versions.

Like other existing configuration error
diagnosis tools~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC, Zhang:2013:ADS}, \ourtool
does not instrument libraries such as the JDK.
A configuration
option set in the client software usually
does not affect the behaviors of its dependent libraries.

%The \ourtool implementation is publicly available at
