Modern software often exposes
a wide range of configuration options for users to
customize its behavior. During software evolution,
developers may change the software's functionality.
When upgrading to a new software version.
users may need to re-configure the software
by changing values of certain configuration options.

This paper addresses a central question during the evolution
of a configurable software system: which configuration option
should a user change to maintain the software's desired behavior?
We present a technique (and its tool implementation,
called \ourtool) to troubleshoot the configuration error
caused by software evolution. 
\ourtool uses dynamic profiling, execution trace
comparison, and static analysis to link the undesired
behavior to its root cause -- a single configuration option
whose value can be changed to produce desired behavior on the new
software version.

We evaluated \ourtool on \errornum configuration errors
from \subjnum configurable software systems written in Java.
On average, the root cause was \ourtool's XXX-ranked
suggestion; in XXX out of XXX errors, the root cause was
one of the top 3 suggestions; and \todo{missing data...}, the root cause was the first suggestion.
Overall, \ourtool produced significantly better results
than XXX alternative approaches.
\ourtool runs in a only a few minutes, making it an attractive
alternative to manual debugging.
