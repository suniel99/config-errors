Modern software often exposes
a wide range of configuration options for users to
customize its behaviors. In software evolution,
changes can unexpectedly affect its existing
functionality, and make the software does not behave as desired.
As a consequence, users often need to re-configure the software
by changing values of certain configuration options,
when upgrading to a new software version.

This paper presents a technique (and its tool implementation,
called \ourtool) to help software users
troubleshoot configuration errors caused by software evolution, 
\ourtool uses dynamic profiling, execution trace
comparison, and static analysis to link the undesired
behavior to its root cause -- a single configuration option
whose value can be changed to produce desired behavior on the new
software version.

We evaluated \ourtool on \errornum configuration errors
from \subjnum configurable software systems written in Java.
On average, the root cause was \ourtool's XXX-ranked
suggestion; in XXX out of XXX errors, the root cause was
one of the top 3 suggestions; and \todo{when ...}, the root cause was the first suggestion.
Overall, \ourtool produced significantly better results
than XXX alternative approaches.
\ourtool runs in a only a few minutes, making it an attractive
alternative to manual debugging.
