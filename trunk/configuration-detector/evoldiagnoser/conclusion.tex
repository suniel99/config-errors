\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Software evolution often causes software sytems to
exhibit undesired behaviors.
When they do, identifying the root causes
can be challenging, especially when a software's
behavior depends on a wide range of configuration options.

This paper describes \ourtool, a technique to recommend
configuration options whose values can be changed to
produce desired behavior on the new software version.
%\ourtool represents a novel synthesis of \todo{} steps:
%records \todo{} and collects \todo{}.
%\ourtool uses \todo{} to attribute .. to
%suspicious configuration options that should
%be re-setted. 
Our experimental results show that \ourtool
can accurately identify the root causes of
\errornum configuration problems in \subjnum real-world software systems.
The source code of \ourtool is publicly available
at: \url{http://config-errors.googlecode.com}.

We consider \ourtool as one step towards improving
the diagnosability of configurable software systems.
Our future work focuses on the following directions:

\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User study.} We plan a user study to evaluate
\ourtool's usefulness to end-users. A challenge
will be finding study participants who are familiar
with our subject programs.

\item \textbf{Formulating guidance of error diagnosis.}
An important question that is not answered in \ourtool
is that how to distinguish bugs from 
configuration errors, when a software system exhibits
undesired behaviors. We plan to formulate guidance
regarding when the user should give up on \ourtool
and assume the error is not related to a configuration option.

\item \textbf{Improving configuration error reporting and fixing.}
Unlike a software bug, a configuration error is mostly
user-driven. Reporting it must combine the software use
scenario with the error-revealing software state.
Further, there is no obviously ``correct'' way to
build configuration logic; also, unlike fixing a bug once,
every software user has to be informed on the right way to
configure the system.  Perhaps as a result, misconfigurations
have been one of the dominant causes of system issues and
is likely to continue so. To address these related problems,
we plan to explore the existing software configuration error
to summarize error patterns, and then use machine learning
techniques to synthesize good-quality error reports and fixes.

%knowledge and manage cross-version configurations.


\end{itemize}

%As future work,  We are also interested
%in developing new problem reporting mechanisms to
%make configuration problems more diagnosable.
%Yet another direction of work will be studying
%test-suite augmentation techniques to automatically
%create new tests that can reveal potential configuration
%problems, as software evolves.
