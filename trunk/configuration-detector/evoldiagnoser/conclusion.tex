\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%Software evolution often causes software systems to
%exhibit undesired behaviors.
%When they do, identifying the root causes
%can be challenging, especially when software's
%behavior depends on a wide range of configuration options.

This paper describes \ourtool, a technique to help software
users to troubleshoot configuration errors. \ourtool
focuses on errors caused by software evolution, and
recommends configuration options whose values should be changed to
produce the desired behavior on the new software version.
In our experiments, \ourtool
accurately identified the root causes of
\errornum configuration errors in \subjnum real-world software systems.
The source code of \ourtool is publicly available
at: \url{http://config-errors.googlecode.com}.

As future work, we plan a user study to evaluate
\ourtool's usefulness to end-users. A challenge
will be finding study participants who are familiar
with only the old versions of given subject programs.
We also plan to develop techniques to
automatically distinguish software bugs from 
configuration errors, when a software system exhibits
undesired behavior.
Such techniques can help formulate guidance
regarding when the user should give up on \ourtool
and assume the error is not related to configuration.

%We consider \ourtool as one step towards improving
%the diagnosability of configurable software systems.

Future work should focus on the following directions:

\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User study.} We plan a user study to evaluate
\ourtool's usefulness to end-users. A challenge
will be finding study participants who are familiar
with given subject programs.

\item \textbf{Formulating guidance of error diagnosis.}
An important question that is not answered in this paper
is how to automatically distinguish software bugs from 
configuration errors, when a software system exhibits
some undesired behavior. We plan to formulate guidance
regarding when the user should give up on \ourtool
and assume the error is not related to a configuration option.

\item \textbf{Improving configuration error reporting and fixing.}
A good bug report for a configuration error should contain both the
failing software state and its use-case scenario.
%When fixing a configuration error, there is no obviously ``correct'' way to
%build configuration logic. 
Unlike fixing a bug once,
every software user has to be informed of the right way to
configure the system. Perhaps as a result, misconfigurations
have been one of the dominant causes of system issues and
are likely to continue so~\cite{Yin:2011:ESC}. To address these related problems,
we plan to further study existing software configuration errors
to summarize error patterns, and then use machine learning
techniques to synthesize good-quality error reports and fixes.
