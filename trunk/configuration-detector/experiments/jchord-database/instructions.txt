Go to the directory ./subjects/jchord/

Run chord from Command line:

go to dir: subjects/jchord/  (should not go to simpletest folder, it will have a very
   tricky pitfall. Essentially, 2 JVMs will be lanunched, each will dump a trace file.
   If went to the simpletest file, the later file by the parent process will override the
   desirabl one)

java -cp ./chord-no-trace-instrumented.jar;../../bin
     -Dchord.class.path=../../../bin;classes/
     -Dchord.work.dir=./simpletest
     -Dchord.run.analyses=datarace-java
     chord.project.Boot
     

//add an option could make the race become apparent
 -Dchord.datarace.exclude.eqth=false
