Software configuration errors are often time-consuming
and difficult to diagnosize. In this paper, we focus
specifically on such configuration errors,
in which the application code is correct, but the software
is inappropriately configured so that it does
behave as desired. 
We present a technique (and its tool implementation,
called \ourtool) to identify the root cause of configuration errors.
Our technique differs from existing approaches in
two aspects: it is fully-automated and does \textit{not}
require users to provide a testing oracle (to check whether
the software functions correctly); and it is
capable to diagnose both \textit{crashing} and \textit{non-crashing}
errors.

%We are focusing specifically on configuration errors, in which the application
%code is correct, but the program is inappropriately configured so that
%it does not behave as desired. For instance, a mistake in a configuration
%option passed in command line may lead software to crash, or simply produce
%incorrect output.

%uses static analysis,
%uses dynamic profiling
%, and uses statistical inference to link the observed
%erroneous behaviors to specific configuration options.

%$\blacksquare$ say a few of our tool's technique


%We have built a tool called \ourtool for Java software.
We evaluated \ourtool on \noncrash non-crashing configuration errors
and \crash crashing configuration errors from
\subjectnum real-world systems. \ourtool identifies the
source of the misconfiguration
as the top 3 root cause for \topnum out of all \errors errors,
%showing its usefulness in error diagnosis.
%showing good scalability and
making it a promising solution in error diagnosis. %alternative to manual debugging.

%results using \ourtool to solve misconfigurations in xxx, xxx, xxx show
%that \ourtool identifies the soruce of the misconfiguration xxxx.
