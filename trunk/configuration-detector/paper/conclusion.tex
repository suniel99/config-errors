\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we have presented a practical technique (and
its tool implementation, called \ourtool) for diagnosing
configuration errors in complex software systems.
Our experimental results show that \ourtool is effective in
diagnosing both crashing and non-crashing configuration errors
and do so with a small profile database.

Our future
work will focus on the following two topics:

\textbf{Fixing configuration errors.} After a configuration error
is localized, fixing it is
often non-trivial and time-consuming. Thus, we
are interested in applying the current advance in
automated error-patching~\cite{rangefix} and
software self-adaptation techniques~\cite{Wang:2009:STR, Mori:2011:LSU} to
fix configuration errors.


\textbf{Improving configuration error reporting.} A high-quality
error report allows software developers to understand and correct the problem
they receive. 
Unfortunately, the quality of error reports often
decreases as software becomes more complex and configurable.
To address this problem, we plan to develop new error reporting mechanisms
to make configuration errors
more diagnosable.
