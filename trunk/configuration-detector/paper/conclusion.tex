\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we have presented a practical technique (and
its tool implementation, called \ourtool) for diagnosing
configuration errors in complex software systems.
Our experimental results show that \ourtool is capable
to diagnose both crashing and non-crashing configuration errors
in realistic systems and do so with a
relatively small number of program profiles in the pre-built database.

The source code of \ourtool is publicly available at:
\url{http://config-errors.googlecode.com}.

%Besides general issues such as performance and ease of use,
Our future
work will focus on the following two topics:

\textbf{Fixing configuration errors.} After a configuration error
is revealed, fixing it is often time-consuming. Recently, work has
been done on automatically
repairing source code~\cite{} and test scripts~\cite{}. However, none
of them focuses on repairing a configuration option error. Thus, we
are interested in developing automated error fixing techniques
for software misconfigurations.

\textbf{Improving configuration error reporting.} A high-quality
error report allows software users to understand and correct the problem
they encounter. 
%Unfortunately, the quality of error reports often
%decreases as software becomes more complex and configurable.
We plan to investigate how to apply the current advance in
program  retrofitting~\cite{} to the context of configuration management,
and improve the error reporting mechanism in large, configurable software systems.

%Combined with automated configuration extraction. Our current
%technique requires developers to spend some one-time effort
%to encode a list of available configuration options. This step
%could be automated by combining with some exsiting work on
%automated configuration option extraction~\cite{}.

%Improve configuration problem reporting mechanism. Many
%programs would produce general error messages when configuration
%errors occur.
