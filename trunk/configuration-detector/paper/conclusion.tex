\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This paper presented a practical technique (and
its tool implementation, called \ourtool) for diagnosing
configuration errors in complex software systems.
Our experimental results show that \ourtool is effective in
diagnosing both crashing and non-crashing configuration errors
and do so with a small profile database.

Our future
work will focus on the following three topics:

\todo{new added}
\textbf{User study.} We plan a user study to evaluate
\ourtool's usefulness to system administrators and
end-users. A challenge will be finding study participants
who are faimiliar with our subject programs.

\textbf{Fixing configuration errors.} After a configuration error
is localized, fixing it is
often non-trivial. Thus, we
plan to apply automated error-patching~\cite{rangefix} and
software self-adaptation techniques~\cite{Wang:2009:STR} to
fix configuration errors.


\textbf{Improving configuration error reporting.} A high-quality
error report allows software developers to understand and correct the problems
they receive. 
Unfortunately, the quality of error reports often
decreases as software becomes more complex and configurable.
We plan to develop new error reporting mechanisms
to make configuration errors
more diagnosable.
