We can see that \ourtool is highly effective in pinpointing the root cause of
misconfigurations. For all \noncrash non-crashing errors
and 5 out of the \crash crashing errors, it lists the actual root cause as one of the top 3 options. 


As shown in Figure~\ref{tab:results}, \ourtool is particularly effective
in diagnosing non-crashing configuration errors, which are not supported
by most existing tools. $\blacksquare$ why effective? observation?
statically significance? Give some examples here... Randoop \CodeIn{maxsize},
Weka behaves overfitting..

\noindent \textbf{Example.} \ourtool outputs the following error report
for Weka:

\begin{CodeOut}
\begin{alltt} 
Suspicious configuration option: m\_numFolds

It affects the behavior of predicate:
"numFold < numInstances() \% numFolds"
(line 1354, class: weka.core.Instances) 

This predicate evaluates to true:
  0\% of the time in normal runs (10 observations)
  70\% of the time in the undesired run (10 observations)

\end{alltt}
\end{CodeOut}


Compared to non-crashing errors, \ourtool is less effective
in diagnosing non-crashing errors. For 4 crashing errors,
the actual causes are ranked lower.
This is because $\blacksquare$ the configuration option has
a long propagation chain, and seems hard for \ourtool
to diagnose correctly. no statistical significance...

Although \ourtool ranked the actual root course of several
crashing errors lower, crashing errors are generally much easier to diagnose than non-crashing errors.
This is because a crashing error usually happens shortly after the program
is launched, and often produces a stack trace with valuable diagnosis clues.
For example, in Figure~\ref{tab:results}, \ourtool ranks the root cause of
error 14  8th.
However, when JChord crashes, it throws a \CodeIn{ClassNotFoundException}
that reminds users to check the classpath setting. For the other three crashing errors (error 8, 10, and 11),
JChord even outputs the wrong configuration option value in the
error message, which
directly guides users to the root cause. We speculated that $\blacksquare$

%The nature of the root-cause configuration option is only one factor.
%The ranking also depends on how the root-cause option relates to
%other options in the suspect set. A highly configurable software system 
%likely produces more noises, 


%The remaining errors are a direct result of $\blacksquare$ and seems
%hard for \ourtool to diagnose correctly.


%\ourtool also successfully diagnoses xx\% of the xxx errors. For the
%remaining errors, \ourtool ranks the root cause 9th. The configuration
%error is that the xxx. Thus, the root cause gets ranked lower
%in the list.
