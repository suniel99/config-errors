``Propagation Analysis'' is described in Section~\ref{sec:prop}.
The ``Instrument'' and ``Run'' components correspond to the Configuration Behavior Profiling step in Section~\ref{sec:profiling}.

\todo{The paper sometimes uses the terminology ``execution profile'' and
  sometimes ``trace''.  Please be consistent.  I like ``execution profile''
  better, because there is no temporal information about ordering in it.}
\todo{The use of ``inputs'', in this figure and elsewhere, suggests that
  the user runs multiple executions.  In fact, it is one execution, right?
  I would change the arrow label ``inputs'' to ``input'' and
  ``configurations'' to ``configuration''.  I would also label them as
  ``bad runs''.  Then, I would change the database symbol's label from
  ``Profile Database'' to ``Profile Database (good runs)''.}
