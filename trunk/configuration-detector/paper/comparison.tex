One possible way to diagnose a configuration error is to leverage
the existing fault localization techniques, by treating the undesired
execution as a failing run and all correct executions (in the database)
as passing runs. We next compare \ourtool with two fault-localization-based
techniques: % in error diagnosis:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Statement-level Coverage Analysis}. This technique treats statements covered
by the undesired execution profile as potentially buggy, and statements
covered the correct execution profiles as correct.
Then, it leverages a well-known fault localization technique,
Tarantula~\cite{Jones:2002}, to rank the likelihood of each
statement being buggy, and queries the results of thin slice
to identify its affecting configuration options as the root causes.

\item \textbf{Method-level Invariant Analysis}. This technique stores invariants detected
by Daikon~\cite{Ernst:1999} from correct execution profiles in the database.
When a configuration error occurs, this technique detects invariants from the undesired execution profile;
and compares the detected invariants with those stored in the database.
It treats a method to have suspicious behaviors if its observed invariants
from the undesired execution profile are different from the invariants stored
in the database~\cite{McCamant:2003}. Finally, this technique ranks a method's suspiciousness by
the number of different invariants, and queries the results of thin slice
to identify its affecting configuration options as the root causes. 
\end{itemize}


The experimental results are shown in Figure~\ref{tab:results} (Columns
``Coverage Analysis'' and ``Invariant Analysis'').
$\blacksquare$ discuss the results here

statement-level granularity is too fine

method-level granularity is too coarse

focusing on the behaviors of the affected predicates can be a good choice.
