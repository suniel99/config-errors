\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented a tool, called \ourtool, on top of the WALA
framework~\cite{wala}. Our tool analyzes Java bytecode.
It statically computes the affected predicates
for each configuration option, assigns a unique
ID for each affected predicate, and then performs offline instrumentation.
The runtime behavior of all affected predicates is recorded
in a file. 

%Using the profile file,
%\ourtool works in a fully automatic and
%push-button way, and scales to realistic programs.


For a Java program, \ourtool does not analyze the standard JDK
library and all the dependent libraries. We believe this approximation
is reasonable, since a configuration option set on client software
usually does not affect the behaviors of its dependent libraries.
