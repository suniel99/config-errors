This step instruments the tested program offline
by inserting code to monitor
each the outcome of each affected predicate at runtime.


For the code in Figure~\ref{fig:example} where
the predicate at line 312 is affected by
the configuration option \CodeIn{maxsize}, \ourtool inserts the
following two instrumentation
statements before and after line 312 to count the number of
the predicate being executed and the number being evaluated to true.


\begin{CodeOut}
\begin{alltt}
310. private ExecutableSequence createNewUniqueSequence() \ttlcb
311.   Sequence newSequence = ...; 
       \underline{incrExecCount("maxsize", "newSequence.size() > maxsize");}
312.   if (newSequence.size() > maxsize) \ttlcb
         \underline{incrTrueCount("maxsize", "newSequence.size() > maxsize");}
314.     return null;
      ...
319. \ttrcb
\end{alltt}
\end{CodeOut}


$\blacksquare$The instrumented program expresses an execution
as a trace comprising a vector of \textit{predicate profiles}.
Each predicate profile is a pair of configuration
option and its affected predicate.
The predicate profile also keeps the recorded runtime information.
%of the affected predicate, including
%the count of the predicate being executed and the count of it
%being evaluated to true. 

%\ourtool expresses an execution as
%a predicate profile vector. 
As we
show in the experiments (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}), such predicate profile
vectors, although by no mean complete, capture
sufficient information to permit users
to reason about the causal effects of configurations
and how they relate to a software's behavior, while
also imposing a moderate amount of performance impact
on foreground applications.


%health as the results of executing a set of predicates.

%As we will show in the experiments~\cite{}, this profile
%provides valuable information about the
%program execution and can help validate a test suite
%or indicate the usage context of a function
%or other computation.

%A software user seeking on specific piece of
%information or aiming to verify a specific invariant
%and uninterested in any other facts about the code
%may be able to use xxx to advantage, but will not
%get as much from it as a programmer open to other,
%possibly valuable information.
