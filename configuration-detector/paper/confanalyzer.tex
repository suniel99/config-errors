
\noindent \textbf{ConfAnalyzer: A Heavyweight Dynamic Information Flow-based Approach~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC}.}
Rabkin and Katz proposed a family of techniques to precompute possible
configuration diagnosis for Java software~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC}. In their work,
the most accurate technique (also probably one of the most precise techniques in the literature)
is based on dynamic information flow analysis.
This technique works remarkably well for crashing errors, though as
described above these are often easy to diagnose even without tool
support.  ConfAnalyzer cannot diagnose non-crashing errors.
