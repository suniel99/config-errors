We compared \ourtool with ConfAnalyzer, a heavyweight dynamic information
flow-based technique~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC}.
We chose ConfAnalyzer because it is one of the most precise configuration
error diagnosis techniques in the literature and its 
experimental data is publicly available.
ConfAnalyzer computes possible configuration diagnosis for Java software,
and works remarkably well for crashing errors, though as
described above these are often easy to diagnose even without tool
support. However, ConfAnalyzer cannot diagnose non-crashing errors.

The experimental results of ConfAnalyzer is shown in Figure~\ref{tab:results} (Column ``ConfAnalyzer'').

In addition to dynamically monitoring
option reads, \ourtool tracks the flow of labelled objects through the
program dynamically. When a configuration value is returned
by a method, that value and the associated option name are
recorded in a lookup table. at bit-level.

Many cases only one configuration value flows into.

For the classpath case, it misses. pollution?


%Rabkin and Katz proposed a family of techniques to precompute possible
%configuration diagnosis for Java software~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC}. In their work,
%the most accurate technique (also probably one of the most precise techniques in the literature)
%is based on dynamic information flow analysis.
