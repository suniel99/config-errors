We compared \ourtool with ConfAnalyzer, a heavyweight dynamic information
flow-based technique~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC}.
We chose ConfAnalyzer because it is one of the most precise configuration
error diagnosis techniques in the literature and its 
experimental data is publicly available.
ConfAnalyzer computes possible configuration diagnosis for Java software,
and works remarkably well for crashing errors, though as
described above these are often easy to diagnose even without tool
support. However, ConfAnalyzer cannot diagnose non-crashing errors.

The experimental results of ConfAnalyzer is shown in Figure~\ref{tab:results} (Column ``ConfAnalyzer'').

%Rabkin and Katz proposed a family of techniques to precompute possible
%configuration diagnosis for Java software~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC}. In their work,
%the most accurate technique (also probably one of the most precise techniques in the literature)
%is based on dynamic information flow analysis.
