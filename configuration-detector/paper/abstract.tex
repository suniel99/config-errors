Moderm software often requires substantial configuration
before being used. Small configuration errors can lead to
hard-to-diagnose erreneous behaviors.
%Software configuration errors are often time-consuming
%and difficult to diagnosize.
In this paper, we focus specifically on software configuration errors,
in which the application code is correct, but the software
is inappropriately configured so that it does not
behave as desired. 
We present a technique (and its tool implementation,
called \ourtool) to identify the root cause of configuration errors.
Our technique differs from existing approaches in
two aspects: it is fully-automated and does \textit{not}
require users to provide a testing oracle (to check whether
the software functions correctly); and it is
capable to diagnose both \textit{crashing} and \textit{non-crashing}
errors.

%, and uses statistical inference to link the observed
%erroneous behaviors to specific configuration options.

%We have built a tool called \ourtool for Java software.
We evaluated \ourtool on \noncrash non-crashing configuration errors
and \crash crashing configuration errors from
\subjectnum real-world systems. \ourtool identifies the
source of the misconfiguration
as the top 3 root cause for \topnum out of all \errors errors,
making it a promising solution in automated debugging. %error diagnosis. %alternative to manual debugging.
