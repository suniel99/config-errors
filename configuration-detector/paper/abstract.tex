Errors from software misconfiguration are often time-consuming
and difficult to diagnosize. In this paper, we present a
technique %helps solve these problems by suggesting
to identify the root cause of configuration errors,
in which the application code is correct, but the software
is inappropriately configured so that it does
behave as desired. %Unlike existing approaches,
Our technique is fully-automated: it does not
require users to provide a testing oracle (to check whether
the software functions correctly) and is
capable to diagnose both crashing and non-crashing
errors.

%We are focusing specifically on configuration errors, in which the application
%code is correct, but the program is inappropriately configured so that
%it does not behave as desired. For instance, a mistake in a configuration
%option passed in command line may lead software to crash, or simply produce
%incorrect output.

%uses static analysis,
%uses dynamic profiling
%, and uses statistical inference to link the observed
%erroneous behaviors to specific configuration options.

%$\blacksquare$ say a few of our tool's technique


We have built a tool called \ourtool for Java software.
In an evaluation on \noncrash real-world non-crashing and \crash crashing configuration
errors, \ourtool identifies the source of the misconfiguration
as the top 3 root cause for \topnum out of all \errors errors,
showing good scalability and making it a promising alternative to manual debugging.

%that xxx -- \ourtool uses these
%xxx to link the erroneous behavior to specific configuration options. Our
%results using \ourtool to solve misconfigurations in xxx, xxx, xxx show
%that \ourtool identifies the soruce of the misconfiguration xxxx.
