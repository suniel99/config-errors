\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

%We have demonstrated a practical, scalable algorithm for isolating
%multiple bugs in complex software systems. Our experimental results
%show that we can detect a wide variety of both anticipated and
%unanticipated causes of failure in realistic systems and do so with a
%relatively modest number of program executions.


Moderm software often requires substantial configuration
before being used. Small configuration errors can lead to
hard-to-diagnose erreneous behaviors.

Our technique can aid users in understanding and
troubleshooting these errors xxx.

Besides general issues such as performance and ease of use, our future
work will concentrate on the following topics:

Combined with automated configuration extraction. Our current
technique requires developers to spend some one-time effort
to encode a list of available configuration options. This step
could be automated by combining with some exsiting work on
automated configuration option extraction~\cite{}.

Improve configuration problem reporting mechanism. Many
programs would produce general error messages when configuration
errors occur.
