\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Software evolution often causes software sytems to
reveal undesired behaviors.
When they do, diagnosing the cause of failure
can be challenging, especially when the software's
behavior depends on a wide range of configuration options.

This paper describes \ourtool, a technique for
automating the diagnosis of configurations errors
caused by a state change.  \ourtool
represents a novel synthesis of \todo{} steps:
records \todo{} and collects \todo{}.
\ourtool uses \todo{} to attribute .. to
suspicious configuration options that should
be re-setted. Our results show that \ourtool
can accurately identify the root causes of
XXX configuration problems in real-world software.
The source code of \ourtool is publicly available
at: \url{http://config-errors.googlecode.com}.

We consider \ourtool as one step towards improving
the diagnosability of configurable software systems.
As future work, we plan a user study to evaluate
\ourtool's usefulness to end-users. A challenge
will be finding study participants who are familiar
with our subject programs. We are also interested
in developing new problem reporting mechanisms to
make configuration problems more diagnosable.
Yet another direction of work will be studying
test-suite augmentation techniques to automatically
create new tests that can reveal potential configuration
problems, as software evolves.
