\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

The \ourtool implementation is publicly available at
\url{http://config-errors.googlecode.com}.
%We implemented \ourtool using the WALA
%framework~\cite{wala}. 
\ourtool uses the WALA framework~\cite{wala} to perform offline
bytecode instrumentation. The instrumentation code
monitors the execution of every statement and the evaluation
result of each predicate, and records the runtime behavior
in a file. \ourtool also uses WALA
to analyze Java bytecode statically to
identify the affecting configuration options
for each predicate that behaves differently across versions.

Like other existing configuration error
diagnosis tools~\cite{Rabkin:2011:PPC, Zhang:2013:ADS}, \ourtool
does not instrument libraries such as the JDK.
This approximation is due to the fact that a configuration
option set on the client software usually
does not affect the behaviors of its dependent libraries.
