\section{Tool Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented \ourtool using the WALA
framework~\cite{}. \ourtool uses WALA
to analyze Java bytecode statically to
compute the affected predicates for each
configuration option. \todo{other parts}.
\ourtool also uses WALA to perform offline
instrumentation. The offline instrumentation
monitors the execution of every statement,
and records the runtime behavior in a file.

Like other existing configuration error
diagnosis tools~\cite{}, \ourtool does not 
instrument the standard JDK library and
all the dependent libraries. This approximation
is due to the fact that a configuration
option set on the client software usually
does not affect the behaviors of its dependent libraries.

\todo{to reduce the overhead, only instrument
every block}
